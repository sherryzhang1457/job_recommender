In cancers, aberrant promoter CpG island hypermethylation correlates highly with gene inactivation and can account for lack of gene expression where mutations do not exist. Dr. Ting is interested in dissecting the mechanisms of epigenetic gene silencing and understanding the functional relevance of DNA methylation in diseases. Dr. Ting's lab has three major focus areas:\n\u2022 Pioneering technical and computational tools for genome-wide DNA methylation assay. Dr. Ting developed MBD-isolated Genome Sequencing (MiGS), which is a cost-effective technique to survey whole genome DNA methylation patterns. The Ting lab also develops computational tools that facilitate sequencing data analyses and interpretation.\n\u2022 Defining novel and clinically relevant functions for DNA methylation. We have defined genome-wide abnormal DNA methylation patternsin colon, bladder, and prostate cancers. Knowing where these disruptions occur enabled us to generate and test hypotheses regarding the function of these changes. We investigate both gene promoters and non-promoter regions with the goal of defining context-specific functions of DNA methylation.\n\u2022 Delineating the mechanics of DNA methylation in cancer. Wide-spread disruptions to DNA methylation patterns are contribute to tumorigenesis and progression, but the regulatory mechanisms that establish, maintain, and modify these patterns are still being worked out. Researchers in Dr. Ting's lab explore the roles for epigenetic enzymes, small non-coding RNAs, and environmental exposures in the initiation and maintenance of abnormal DNA methylation patterns in cancer.\n\nPlease note this role is Hybrid Onsite/Remote. Some job duties can be fulfilled partially remotely but may require some time spent onsite - typically one to two days per week.\n\nKEY FUNCTIONS\n\nSequencing Data Analysis\n\u2022 Assist with writing computer codes to establish new computational pipelines using R, Python, and C++.\n\u2022 Create new scripts as directed to carry out specific data manipulation or adapt published software to project needs and computational infrastructure.\n\u2022 With supervision and assistance from senior bioinformatics personnel and PI, perform genomic data analyses, such as single cell RNA-seq, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and HiC-seq.\n\u2022 Provide assistance and input in developing and implementing workflow for data analysis in collaboration with research scientists.
