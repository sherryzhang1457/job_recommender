When you join the E3 team, you will be working on some of the most important energy issues with some of the top minds in the electricity industry. We help shape energy and climate policy, play vital roles in regulatory proceedings, advise executives, and inform investment and planning selections. At E3, you will be challenged and inspired.

Who We Are

Founded in 1989, Energy + Environmental Economics (E3) is a fast-growing energy consulting firm that helps utilities, regulators, policy makers, developers, and investors make the most educated strategic decisions possible as they implement new public policies, deploy and develop new technologies, and address customers’ shifting expectations. We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Boston, Denver, and Calgary.

Because E3 works with customers from all sectors of the electricity industry, we provide a 360-degree knowledge of markets, planning, policy, regulation, and environmental factors. Just as important, we are driven to deliver clear, unbiased evaluations that help customers make informed decisions.

E3 works on high-profile, high-impact projects in jurisdictions that spearhead the implementation of clean energy policy. In California, Hawaii, and New York, we are advising state agencies and regulators about how to implement clean energy policies with an emphasis on customer incentives and markets. E3 is also expanding its international presence with recent projects in Europe, China, India, and Africa.

The Role

E3 is hiring for a new role in its Climate Pathways & Electrification practice area to join the Forecasting Anywhere product team. We are looking for someone passionate about staying on top of innovations in data science and leveraging new methods and algorithms to solve challenging analytical problems.

You will join the E3 team developing software tools providing granular geospatial forecasts of electric load and distributed energy resource (DER) adoption to support regulatory policy and utility distribution planning for the clean energy transition. The DERs modeled include distributed solar (PV), energy storage, electric vehicles, and building electrification measures among others. The tools use data from a variety of sources that are pre-processed and stored in a datalake for geospatial analysis using Uber’s H3 indexing system. This tool has been used to visualize EV charger installations in disadvantaged communities in California, distribution network capacity constraints from transportation and building electrification in New York City and geospatially granular adoption of DER in Nevada.

In this role, you will work closely with product managers, user research, engineers, product & lifecycle marketing, and operational stakeholders to foster a data-driven product development culture, advise our product roadmaps, and build a deep understanding of member behavior.

We're hiring across several levels. The base salary offered for this role and level of experience will begin at $118,100 USD ($91,500 CAD) and up to $185,100 USD ($143,400 CAD).

• Familiarity in R or python - you write reproducible code and have a tendency toward automation.
• Experience leading experimentation, statistical analysis, and sophisticated measurement (e.g. causal inference) E2E to guide decision making.
• Hands-on experience with BI/Visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, PowerBI, etc).
• Experience building metric frameworks to understand user behaviors.
• Ability to think holistically to solve business problems at hand and navigate through ambiguity.

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do.

As a marketing data scientist, you will play a critical role in accelerating Notion's growth by building and improving how we measure the impact of all our marketing efforts, such as brand campaigns and community. You will work closely with our marketing and engineering teams to make effective spending decisions across our marketing channels, recommend the most effective messaging and creatives from experiment design and analyses, and explore new opportunities for growing Notion's user base and business.

What You'll Achieve

• You will design, launch and analyze experiments to understand the incrementality of different messaging and creative campaigns.

• You will partner closely with all marketing teams to make critical decisions about where we invest our marketing efforts, understanding the impact of our business, defining key success metrics and core segmentations.
• You will influence your team's roadmap by sharing your findings with the rest of the company, and driving and verifying change in our marketing channel spend. (Insights are useful, but impact is even better!)

Skills You'll Need To Bring
• You have spent meaningful time as a data scientist partnering with business functions ideally with paid marketing teams and having expertise in analyzing brand campaigns.
• You can draw on that experience to identify where data can have the most impact and clearly communicate your findings and recommendations to your partner teams.
• You relish turning ambiguous questions and problems into clear deliverables and insights.
• You are an expert in SQL and at least one of scripting languages such as R/Python.
• You are comfortable transforming raw data to build your own data sets if the metrics and reporting you need don’t exist yet.
• You have a bias for using the right tools to get a job done with maximum efficiency. You have experience making tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

Nice To Haves
• You have worked at a fast-growing start-up.
• You have experience at a B2B SaaS company.
• You have solid experience working with marketing teams to drive decision-making.
