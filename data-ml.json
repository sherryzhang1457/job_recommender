A day in the life of a machine learning engineer at PNNL might begin with a few hours of writing code and unit tests to add an API for a new model into an analytics web service. When the feature is complete, you verify that the build passes in the CI system and submit a PR for your teammates to review. After that, you have a standup with the project team and then a meeting with the project data scientist to discuss solutions for improving the performance of an existing NER model on a certain class of inputs for which it is performing poorly. After your meetings, you adjust some labels on the input dataset based on the data scientist's feedback, retrain the model, and see that it is performing much better than the previous version. You tag the new model and trigger a deployment to update the new model's staging application. After lunch, you context switch to your other project where you are evaluating a new vector database that you hope will help improve the functionality of image similarity search by enabling users to filter images before ranking them. You get the Docker container running and then work through a tutorial to figure out how to load feature vectors and metadata.

Some of the active research areas include System Wide Optimization, AI for Non-linear Dynamics, Deep Learning for Process Modeling and Failure Prediction Analysis among others.\n\nThis internship will focus on applying IP techniques to handle machine learning problems. For instance, an active research area in our team is developing a MIP formulation for an optimal decision tree, or learning optimal DNF rules, that handles categorical and numerical features, for multiclass classification or regression problems. Much of the existing research in this space addresses binary classification with categorical features, and most models do not scale well for large datasets that contain hundreds of thousands of samples. For this problem, the intern would work on formulating a mixed integer program to handle numerical features and regression problems, and devise and implement a scalable algorithm.\n\nRequired Technical and Professional Expertise\n\u2022 An advanced background in integer and linear programming theory, combinatorial optimization and algorithms including, but not limited to, cutting-plane, primal-dual, decomposition and approximation algorithms is a plus.\n\u2022 Ideal candidates should be able to independently identify an innovative research path/solution for a given research problem and implement the solution within the course of the internship.
