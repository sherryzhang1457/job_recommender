"job_description": "Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning approach where multiple data owners, referred to as clients, train a model together under the orchestration of a central server by sharing the model trained on their local datasets instead of sharing the data directly. FL enables creation of more robust models without the exposure of local datasets. However, FL by itself, does not guarantee the privacy of data, because the information extracted from the communication of FL algorithms can be accumulated and utilized to infer the private local data used for training. We developed Argonne Privacy Preserving Federated Learning framework (APPFL), with advances in differential privacy, to enable Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning (PPFL). We enabled training of AI models in a distributed setting across multiple institutions, where sensitive data are located, with the ability to scale on supercomputing resources to help create robust, trust-worthy AI models in biomedicine and smart grid applications where data privacy is essential. Setting up a secure federated learning experiment that needs high performance computational resources across distributed sites requires technical capabilities that may not be available for all. To lower the barrier to entry for leveraging PPFL and to enable domain experts in large institutions to utilize FL, we created the Argonne Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning as a service (APPFLx), which enables cross-silo PPFL using easy to use web interface for managing, deploying, analyzing, and visualizing PPFL experiments. Successful candidates will have experience in developing FL frameworks, developing benchmarks for FL frameworks, fine-tuning LLMs using FL frameworks. Position Requirements Working experience in Privacy preserving Federated Learning frameworks Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Mathematics, or a related field, and 0+ years of experience. Strong programming skills in Python and experience with relevant Machine Learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch). Solid understanding of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques, particularly in the areas of federated learning, distributed optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques. Experience with cryptographic protocols, secure multi-party computation, and homomorphic encryption techniques is highly desirable. Familiarity with data privacy regulations and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). Excellent problem-solving, analytical, and critical thinking skills. Strong communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work effectively in a cross-functional team environment. Proficiency in writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Proven ability to learn and adapt to new technologies and methodologies. Ability to model Argonne's core values of impact, respect, safety, integrity, and teamwork.

Team members independently drive greenfield projects, work closely with Cloudflare product and engineering teams on shared objectives, and build strong collaborations with both external organizations and other organizations within Cloudflare to achieve common goals.\n\nCloudflare Research embarks upon projects that help shape the future of the Internet at large, and the systems that drive it. We design, develop, and deploy these projects into Cloudflare systems to demonstrate their impact, and to share that knowledge with the wider standards and research communities -- often in collaboration with university or other industry labs. A sample of our recent high-profile works include Constellation AI, Encrypted Client Hello (ECH), Post Quantum Encryption, CAP, ZKP for browsers, and Addressing Agility. Our current research directions include applied cryptography, privacy, network protocols and architecture, measurement and performance evaluation, AI and ML for systems, systems for AI, and general distributed systems optimization. We are open to researchers in all of these areas, and particularly solicit applications from researchers with backgrounds in ML for Systems or Systems for ML. Particular attention will be paid to candidates with a background in ML and storage or network optimization.\n\nMore information about Cloudflare's approach to research can be found here.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nCloudflare Research is looking for a senior ML researcher who is eager to help define and identify projects in the AI/ML space that Cloudflare is uniquely poised to build and benefit from. Researchers and engineers across the Research Teams investigate new ideas, build new technologies, inform and execute telemetry, engage with global communities, and even dive into existing codebases to make meaningful changes in production environments. Prioritization and planning are key elements as the nature of the team\u2019s research necessarily shifts between putting ideas into practice and onto paper, while ensuring rigorous evaluations of performance, correctness, or impact.
